\begin{abstract}
The word ``optimal'' is used widely in astronomy, but its semantics
in the astronomical literature
may be unfamiliar to researchers from other fields.  Here we give
our interpretations of various ways the word is used in the literature.

\section{Introduction}

Use of the word ``optimal'' in the abstracts of papers posted to the
arXiv pre-print service has been increasing for the last 15 years, as
shown in Figure 1.  We used the arXiv API to query articles in the
``astro-ph'' category containing the term ``optimal'' in the abstract.
The total number of articles per year were compiled from the summary
statistics pages on the arXiv web site.

  preprints.}

Before exploring the use of the word in the astronomical literature, let
us present definitions that might be recognizable to researchers from other
disciplines.

\begin{description}
\item[Optimal (of a parameter):] achieving the maximum of a
  well-specified scalar objective function.  That is, a parameter
  $\hat{\theta}$ can be said to be \emph{optimal} in $f$ if and only
  if
  \[
  \hat{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta} f(\theta)
  \]
\item[Optimal (of a method, algorithm, or procedure):] achieving the
  best possible value of a specified scalar performance metric among a
  specified group of algorithms.
  %
  % For example,  ... Cramer--Rao
  %
\item[Optimize:] the act of discovering an optimal value through analytic or
  numerical means.
\end{description}

\section{``Optimal'' in Astronomy}

A variety of uses of the word ``optimal'' can be found in astronomy.
Here we show a number of examples with our interpretations (XXX
translations?) of their semantics.
%
Specific references to the literature have been suppressed, but in the
name of fairness, these examples are all drawn from documents
coauthored by the authors of this guide.


\paragraph{``We present an optimal algorithm.''}
The authors present a good algorithm.  And by good, they
mean that they like it.  They like it because they wrote it, and it
even seemed to work better on the \emph{two} different test images
they ran it on.  At least, it looked better to them.  They plan
to make the code public in the near future.

\paragraph{``\emph{A} is more optimal than \emph{B}.''}
Neither \emph{A} nor \emph{B} is any good.  The phrase
``more optimal'' of course indicates that the writer has never climbed
to the top of a hill and has not in any way quantitatively evaluated
\emph{A} versus \emph{B}.  Further, if \emph{A} were truly optimal, it
would be fruitless to search for a superior \emph{B}; the fact that
the claim is being made probably means that \emph{A} has not been
shown to be optimal.

\paragraph{``It is not clear that this method is optimal.''}
The method is horrible, but it was written by the author's supervisor
so the author is afraid to criticize it.


\paragraph{``Data set \emph{A} is nearly optimal for our science.''}
The authors have access to data set \emph{A}.


\paragraph{``Further simulation is required to optimize the survey design.''}
%
%The authors have no idea what they are doing

The authors have no idea what they are going to do.

\paragraph{``This is an ``optimal'' method.''}
Even the authors know the method is not optimal, but they just can't bring
themselves to write ``good'' instead.

\paragraph{``We choose optimal parameters $\alpha=500$ and $\beta=7.42$''}
The authors chose the number $500$ because it is a round number and
the parameter $\alpha$ doesn't seem to do anything at all, and $7.42$
because any other value of $\beta$ they try causes the code to
segfault.

\paragraph{``Our survey strategy optimally maximizes \emph{A} and \emph{B} while minimizing \emph{C}.''}
The survey strategy code was written in Perl by a grad student who
graduated a decade ago and now works for an insurance company.  Nobody
else in the lab can even read the code, never mind modify it, and it
uses parameters for a different telescope than the one the survey will
be carried out on.  Due to an elaborate series of bugs, it achieves
median performance on \emph{A} and random performance on \emph{B},
while maximizing \emph{C}.

%Successive generations of graduate
%students have carefully maintained the

\paragraph{``This method could be further optimized.''}
The authors have not optimized it yet and have no plans to do so.

\paragraph{``We set the parameter to optimally trade off between \emph{A} and \emph{B}''}
The authors set the parameter to halfway between what is best for
\emph{A} and what is best for \emph{B}.

\paragraph{``Our pilot survey aimed at an optimal selection of targets''}
The authors tried really hard.

\paragraph{``As shown in Lemma 4, the variance of our estimator saturates
the Cram\'er--Rao bound''}
This was written by the collaborator from the Statistics Department.


\section{Conclusions}

We hope that this guide will optimize communication between astronomers
and collaborators from other disciplines.
